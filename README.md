# Save The Keeper Fixed

Dota 2 custom map, fixed version of the [map made by Primo](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943694786).

[Steam Workshop link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3413663797)

### Brief code overview

`game` folder includes various scripts and KeyValues dicts, creep logic, spawns, hero balancing

`content` folder includes ui, textures. It DOES NOT include .vmap files of the original game. I wasn't able to decompile the original map, various map's `.vpk` files that are featured in `game` might become unusable in the future 

`other` features various files: images, patchnotes, devlogs, some math calculations
